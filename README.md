# ps6-shiny-timur-l

This app utilizes satellite temperature data from the University of Alabama in Huntsville and shows the 
various temperatures from various regions during each month from the end of 1978 to the beginning of 2023.
The widgets on the side panel of the graph tab allow you to choose which region of the world you can choose to display on the 
graph which will be on the main panel. You can also choose whether to display the data as a scatter plot or a line plot. Finally 
you can choose what colour you want your data to be displayed in. This will also display however many non-missing observations 
are shown in this region, which is shown below the graph on the main panel. On the table tab you can change which region you 
want the table to display data for. This will also display the average temperature for this selected region at the bottom of the 
table on the main panel.
